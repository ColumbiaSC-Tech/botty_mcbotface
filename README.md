# Setup

## Overview

A [slackbot](https://github.com/lins05/slackbot) plugin that acts as a general purpose Slack bot.
Although botty_mcbotface is not sentient, it does display a little sense of humor.

Much inspiration drawn from snoonet's [gonzobot](https://github.com/snoonetIRC/CloudBot) for IRC.

**Note on Contributing:** At this point in time no PR's will be accepted until after V1.0 release.
Currently this readme is more of a *plan* than reality. However, V1.0 should be ready very soon.

## Installation

1. Setup [slackbot](https://github.com/lins05/slackbot)
2. `pip install botty_mcbotface`
3. In slackbot_settings.py:
    * Add `botty_mcbotface.plugins` to PLUGINS list
    * Configure Python Variables in slackbot_settings.py
