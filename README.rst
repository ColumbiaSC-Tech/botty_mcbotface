Setup
=====

Overview
--------

A `slackbot <https://github.com/lins05/slackbot>`__ plugin that acts as
a general purpose Slack bot. Although botty\_mcbotface is not sentient,
it does display a little sense of humor.

Much inspiration drawn from snoonet's
`gonzobot <https://github.com/snoonetIRC/CloudBot>`__ for IRC.

**Note on Contributing:** At this point in time no PR's will be accepted
until after V1.0 release. Currently this readme is more of a *plan* than
reality. However, V1.0 should be ready very soon.

Installation
------------

1. Setup `slackbot <https://github.com/lins05/slackbot>`__
2. ``pip install botty_mcbotface``
3. In slackbot\_settings.py:

   -  Add ``botty_mcbotface.plugins`` to PLUGINS list
   -  Configure Python Variables in slackbot\_settings.py
