Overview
********

A `slackbot <https://github.com/lins05/slackbot>`__ plugin that acts as
a general purpose Slack bot. Although botty\_mcbotface is not sentient,
it does display a little sense of humor.

Much inspiration drawn from snoonet's
`gonzobot <https://github.com/snoonetIRC/CloudBot>`__ for IRC. The main
build is from lins05's
`slackbot <https://github.com/lins05/slackbot>`__, which
botty\_mcbotface is technically a plugin for (though he himself has a
multitude of plugins as well).
